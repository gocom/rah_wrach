h1. rah_wrach

"Packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/rah/rah_wrach | "Issues":https://github.com/gocom/rah_wrach/issues | "Donate":https://rahforum.biz/donate/rah_wrach

Rah_wrach adds an extra step to the "Textpattern CMS":https://textpattern.com article publishing process. The plugin presents a prompt and makes site authors pick the "section":https://docs.textpattern.com/administration/sections-panel before going to the actual editor present on the "Write panel":https://docs.textpattern.com/administration/write-panel. The extra step will hopefully increase the change of articles actually going to correct sections.

h2. Install

Using "Composer":https://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer require rah/rah_wrach

h2. Preferences

Rah_wrach introduces few settings. All the available settings can be found from Textpattern's "preferences panel":https://docs.textpattern.com/administration/preferences-panel, organized under a *Wrach* section. The following settings will be present.

h3. Display the following sections (comma-separated)

Sets which sections are listed in the section prompt. The field takes a comma-separated list of section names. Sections will be listed in the prompt in the order they are specified in the field.

bc. news, articles, design

The above would bring News section to the top of the prompt and list Design the last. If the field is left empty, all sections are present in the prompt, sorted in an alphabetical order.

h3. Hide the section input?

If set to _Yes_, the _Sections_ selection field on the "article":https://docs.textpattern.com/administration/write-panel editor is permanently hidden. Once a section is chosen from the prompt, the editor won't offer an option to change the section. You will still be able to change the section for an existing article with the multi-editing tool residing on the "article":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Articles list.
